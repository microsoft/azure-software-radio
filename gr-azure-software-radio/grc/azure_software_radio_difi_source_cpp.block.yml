documentation: |-
     A DIFI source block is based on IEEE-ISTO Std 4900-2021: Digital IF Interoperability Standard
     The block is not fully compliant just yet. Bit Depths supported are currently 8 and 16 with full support coming at a later date.
     
     This block will emit the following tags in the following situations-
     pck_n tag:
     Emitted when a missed packet occurs, will update the upstream blocks with the current packet number to expect and the current time stamps
     context tag:
     Emitted when a new DIFI context packet is recieved with the context packet dynamic information
     static_change:
     Emitted when the static parts of the DIFI context packet changes

     DIFI Advanced:
     This tab contains more advanced settings for the DIFI block and should be used by users who know the devices and network in use. 

     Context Packet Mismatch Behavior:
       - Default: Throws exceptions if context packet is incorrect or non-compliant
       - Ignore Mismatches - Forward data, no warnings: Entirely ignore the context packet, only forwards data
       - Throw Warnings - Forward: Displays Warnings about context packet mismatch or non-compliant context packets, but still forward DIFI data. 
       - Throw Warnings - No Forward: Displays Warnings about context packet mismatch or non-compliant context packets, but won't forward data until a correct context packet is received or one that matches the given settings
    
     ===Params===
     
     ip_addr:
     The ip address for the socket to expect DIFI packets from
     
     port:
     the port number for the socket
     
     stream_number:
     The DIFI (VITA) stream number to expect for this stream. If stream number is -1, the stream number will be ignored, else it will be checked against the stream number in the DIFI (VITA) packets. If they do match, the packets will be dropped.
     
     bit_depth:
     The bit depth
     
     context_pkt_behavior:
     Set the behavior of handling non-compliant context packets.
